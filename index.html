		<p>he Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a 2017 action-adventure game developed 
			and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles. Breath of the Wild 
			is the nineteenth installment of The Legend of Zelda franchise and is set at the end of 
			the Zelda timeline. The player controls Link, who awakens from a hundred-year slumber to 
			defeat Calamity Ganon and restore the kingdom of Hyrule.</p>

		<p>Similar to the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda game, players are given little 
			instruction and can explore the world freely. Tasks include collecting 
			various items and gear to aid in objectives such as puzzle-solving or side quests. 
			The world is unstructured and designed to encourage exploration and experimentation, 
			and the main story quest can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.</p>
